I'm currently a PhD student at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte working under the supervision of Dr. Minwoo Lee. I am interested in machine learning and computer vision, particularly my research is focused on the subfields of machine learning i.e., few-shot learning, meta-learning and continual learning in neural networks.
